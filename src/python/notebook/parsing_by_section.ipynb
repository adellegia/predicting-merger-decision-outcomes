      "passenger  and  cargo  transport  between  Europe  and  the  United  States.  The  proposed\n",

      "Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice (OJ C 95, 16.4.2008, p. 1). The parties’ turnover figures are based on a 50:50\n",
      "split between the country of departure and the country of final destination (see also Case COMP/M.4439 -\n",

      "origin of the flights as considered in Ryanair/Aer Lingus case, the Community dimension thresholds would be\n",
      "equally satisfied.. (1)  Point of origin/point of destination (\"O&D\") pairs\n",
      "8.  The Commission has in the past defined the relevant market for scheduled passenger air\n",
      "transport services on the basis of the (cid:147)point of origin/point of destination(cid:148) (O&D) city-pair\n",
      "approach3.  This  market  definition  corresponds  to  the  demand-side  perspective  whereby\n",
      "customers consider all possible alternatives of travelling from a point of origin (\"O\") to a\n",
      "point of destination (\"D\"), which they do not consider substitutable to a different city-pair.\n",
      "On this basis, every combination of a point of origin and a point of destination is considered\n",
      "to be a separate market.\n",
      "9.  The Commission has nevertheless in the past also taken into consideration supply-side\n",
      "elements  such  as  network  competition  between  airlines  based  on  the  hub-and-spoke\n",
      "structure of traditional carriers. Although in theory from a supply-side perspective a carrier\n",
      "could fly from any point of origin to any point of destination, in practice the network carriers\n",
      "construct their network and take decisions to fly almost exclusively on routes connecting to\n",
      "their hubs. From a demand-side perspective, it was generally considered that while networks\n",
      "have some importance for corporate customers whose demand is driven both by network\n",
      "effects and O&D considerations, their role remains rather limited for individual customers\n",
      "who are normally concerned with finding the cheapest and most convenient connection\n",
      "between two cities4.\n",
      "10.  The market investigation has generally confirmed that the market should be defined on the\n",
      "basis  of  the  Commission’s  traditional  O&D  city  pair  approach.  Indeed,  the  market\n",
      "investigation indicated that individual customers would not substitute one O&D for another.\n",
      "While the scope of a network is one of the decisive parameters taken into account by\n",
      "corporate customers when contracting with airlines and the discounts granted by airlines to\n",
      "corporate  customers  are  conditional  upon  corporate  customers  purchasing  the  tickets\n",
      "generally  on  a  network  (rather  than  on  a  route-by-route  basis),  corporate  customers’\n",
      "employees needs still revolve around transport from one point to another and competition\n",
      "still takes place on an O&D city pair basis.\n",
      "11.  Accordingly, for the purpose of this decision, the relevant markets should be defined on an\n",
      "O&D basis.\n",
      "(2)  Time-sensitive v. non time-sensitive passengers\n",
      "12.  The Commission has traditionally found that passengers travelling on unrestricted tickets,\n",
      "i.e.  time-sensitive  passengers  which  are  mainly  business  customers  having  a  need  for\n",
      "flexibility, may be in a different market from passengers travelling on restricted tickets, so-\n",

      "at paragraph 15. 13.  In its recent Ryaniar/Aer Lingus6 decision the Commission did not distinguish between\n",
      "time-sensitive and non time-sensitive passengers. However, there is a clear difference with\n",
      "the present case as in Europe both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are low-frills short-haul point-to-\n",
      "point operators selling one type of tickets whereas the case at hand relates to a merger\n",
      "between two network airlines offering transatlantic long haul flights, selling different types\n",
      "of tickets targeting different categories of passengers and achieving a considerable part of\n",
      "their turnover through sales to business or time-sensitive passengers.\n",
      "14.  The market investigation in the present case has confirmed that this distinction is still\n",
      "relevant although the boundaries between time-sensitive and non time-sensitive passengers\n",
      "have become more blurred over time and there is rather a continuum of types of passengers\n",
      "having various combinations of preferences with respect to price, flexibility of ticket and\n",
      "frequency of flights. In particular, there is a trend among corporate customers, representing\n",
      "most of the time-sensitive passengers, to be more flexible and prioritise the price of the\n",
      "ticket  over  other  factors,  such  as  time.  One  respondent  to  the  Commission’s  market\n",
      "investigation indicated that the \"companies tend to move towards the \"cheapest logical fare\"\n",
      "meaning that companies are still willing to pay more for improved flexibility and travel\n",
      "convenience  as  long  as  amounts  are  perceived  reasonable.\"  However,  this  distinction\n",
      "remains still important due to different needs and requirements of time-sensitive passengers\n",
      "as concerns the flexibility of tickets, possibility of late bookings and the service offered on\n",
      "the aircraft. In addition, from a supply-side perspective, airlines’ yield and their business\n",
      "strategy are to a large extent driven by this distinction.\n",
      "15.  In any case, the existence of distinct markets for time sensitive and non-time sensitive\n",
      "passengers can be left open as it does not alter the competition assessment in the present\n",
      "case.\n",
      "(3)  Substitutability of direct and indirect flights\n",
      "16.  With respect to long-haul flights the Commission has found in the past7 that indirect flights\n",
      "constitute  a  competitive  alternative  to  non-stop  services  under  certain  conditions  in\n",
      "particular when they are marketed as connecting flights on an O&D pair in the computer\n",
      "reservation systems, they operate on a daily basis and they only result in a limited increase\n",
      "of travelling time (max. 150 minutes of waiting time).\n",
      "17.  The market investigation has largely confirmed that indirect flights constitute an alternative\n",
      "to direct flights for the transatlantic city-pairs considered. This is particularly true for non\n",
      "time-sensitive passengers. With respect to time-sensitive passengers, it is clear that in case\n",
      "both direct and indirect flights are offered, there is a clear preference for a direct flight.\n",
      "However, in some circumstances, and in particular where the frequencies/schedules of an\n",
      "indirect service are more convenient or when there is a company policy whereby some\n",
      "airlines are preferred over the others, an indirect service may constitute a substitute even for\n",
      "                                                \n",

      "7  See, e.g., Case COMP/M.2041 - United/US Airways, at paragraphs 13-19 as regards specifically transatlantic\n",
      "city-pairs. time-sensitive passengers. Moreover, in line with the increased price-sensitivity of corporate\n",
      "customers the market investigation indicated that some corporate customers have policies\n",
      "whereby they incite their employees to take reasonable connecting flights, in particular when\n",
      "the price difference is substantial.\n",
      "18.  Accordingly, for the purposes of the present decision, indirect flights resulting in only a\n",
      "limited increase in time are considered to be part of the same relevant market on each\n",
      "relevant transatlantic city-pair.\n",
      "B. Air cargo transport\n",
      "19.  With respect to air cargo market, the Commission has previously found that O&D approach\n",
      "to market definition is inappropriate given that cargo is generally less time-sensitive than\n",
      "passengers and that cargo is commonly transported by trans-modal methods beyond and\n",
      "behind the origin and destination points. Accordingly, the geographic market can be defined\n",
      "wider  and  as  concerns  the  intercontinental  routes,  the  corresponding  catchment  areas\n",
      "broadly correspond to continents, at least for those continents where local infrastructure is\n",
      "adequate to allow for onward connections8. This is the case of the North Atlantic routes\n",
      "(routes between Europe and North America) affected by the present transaction. In this\n",
      "respect it should be noted that the cargo transport is by nature unidirectional as the demand\n",
      "on each end of the route differs substantially. Accordingly, the relevant markets have to be\n",
      "defined on this basis.\n",
      "20.  The Commission in previous cases left open the question whether the market for air cargo\n",
      "transport should be further subdivided depending on the nature of transported goods. The\n",
      "Commission however indicated that some type of goods, such as dangerous goods, may\n",
      "require special handling so that they can be transported only on full-freighter aircraft9.\n",
      "However, on the transatlantic routes concerned by the present transaction neither of the\n",
      "parties operates dedicated cargo aircraft which could allow for this special treatment and\n",
      "thus typically they transport general cargo. In light of this and the parties’ limited activities\n",
      "in the transport of air cargo between Europe and the U.S., it is irrelevant for the purposes of\n",
      "this case to further subdivide the cargo market.\n",
      "21.  Accordingly, the relevant markets for the purpose of this case are the transport of air cargo\n",
      "from Europe to North America and the transport of air cargo from North America to Europe.\n",
      "                                                \n",

      "would result from the notified merger with the conditions that would have prevailed without\n",
      "the merger (\"the counterfactual\"), so as to determine whether the proposed concentration\n",
      "would significantly impede effective competition, in particular as a result of the creation or\n",
      "strengthening of a dominant position.10 The competitive conditions existing at the time of\n",
      "the merger, as well as future changes to the market that can reasonably be predicted,\n",
      "constitute the relevant point of comparison11.\n",
      "The position of the notifying party\n",
      "23.  The  notifying  party  submits  that,  as  a  result  of  a  significant  number  of  cooperation\n",
      "agreements, Northwest and Delta already do not compete on a certain number of routes and\n",
      "notably on all transatlantic routes between the U.S. and the EEA. They therefore claim that\n",
      "the relevant counterfactual is a situation characterized by the absence of competition, at least\n",
      "on  these  markets,  to  conclude  that  \"the  merger  does  not  therefore  eliminate  existing\n",
      "competition such that an SIEC could conceivably result\".\n",
      "The Commission’s position\n",
      "24.  Delta and NWA are both members of the SkyTeam alliance12. Airline alliances such as\n",
      "SkyTeam provide the framework for numerous bilateral and/or multilateral cooperation\n",
      "agreements between the alliance members which amount to various degrees of cooperation\n",
      "between members. The alliance agreement lists a number of areas for potential cooperation,\n",
      "which may range from plain code-sharing on a single route to worldwide network and fare\n",
      "coordination. Accordingly, the degree of cooperation varies not only between alliances but\n",
      "also within one alliance between its various members. It can range from a simple marketing\n",
      "alliance in which the airlines cooperate through the use of a common alliance brand, product\n",
      "development,  code-sharing,  frequent  flyer  participation  agreements,  and  airport  lounge\n",

      "participants combine their networks and share a common bottom line.\n",
      "25.  The degree of cooperation existing between various alliance members determines the level\n",
      "of competition between them. In past merger  and  antitrust  cases,  the  Commission  has\n",
      "considered that alliance members with a loose degree of cooperation compete13 whilst other\n",
      "members belonging to highly integrated alliance cannot be considered as competitors as\n",
      "their cooperation affects their incentives to compete to an extent that they no longer exert\n",
      "any competitive pressure on each other14. As a result, the Commission for the purpose of the\n",
      "assessment of airline mergers has aggregated the market shares of those alliance partners\n",
      "which cooperate extensively and thus do not have an incentive to compete.\n",
      "26.  As regards SkyTeam more specifically, the Commission found in its 2004 review of the Air\n",
      "France/KLM merger that due to Air France and KLM’s respective cooperation agreements\n",
      "(the SkyTeam alliance and the KLM/Northwest joint venture), the merger would not only\n",
      "eliminate competition between Air France and KLM, but also between their respective\n",
      "partners Delta, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines, Northwest and Kenya Airlines15.\n",
      "27.  Accordingly, as regards transatlantic routes, the Commission assessed not only the overlaps\n",
      "between Air France and KLM but also the overlap between KLM and Delta (Air France’s\n",
      "close partner)16 and between Air France and Northwest (KLM’s joint venture partner for\n",
      "transatlantic routes17)18, and added the market share of all SkyTeam partners on the affected\n",
      "routes. On this basis, the Commission found that the merger risked creating a dominant\n",
      "position on the transatlantic routes Amsterdam-New York (between hubs of KLM and\n",
      "Delta), Amsterdam-Atlanta (between hubs of KLM and Delta), and Paris-Detroit (between\n",

      "slot  releases  at  Amsterdam  and  Paris  airports  for  operations  on  these  3  routes,  the\n",
      "Commission approved the merger.\n",
      "28.  As a result of the merger of Air France and KLM, NWA and Delta each cooperate closely\n",
      "on transatlantic routes with Air France/KLM. Therefore, indirectly through their respective\n",
      "close cooperation with the same legal entity Air France/KLM, Delta and NWA already do\n",
      "not have any incentive to compete on transatlantic routes despite the lack of U.S. antitrust\n",

      "13  See Commission decision in Case COMP/M. 3280 - Air France/KLM, at paragraphs  56 and 63, where the\n",
      "existing degree of commercial cooperation between KLM/Northwest on the one hand and Continental on the\n",
      "other hand (namely cooperation limited to code-sharing) allowed the Commission to conclude that these entities\n",
      "competed and maintained an incentive to compete on transatlantic routes.\n",
      "14  See, e.g., Commission decision in Case COMP/M.3770 - Lufthansa/Swiss, at paragraph 22 finding that Austrian\n",
      "Airlines, bmi, SAS, and United Airlines cannot be considered as competitors of Lufthansa.\n",

      "16  See in particular paragraph 109 as regards the overlap between KLM/NW and Delta on Amsterdam-New York.\n",
      "17  The KLM/NWA joint venture is centred on Amsterdam-Schiphol airport from which the two airlines operate\n",
      "joint venture flights to 20 cities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico and two cities in India. The joint venture also\n",
      "includes NWA’s flights from the U.S. to four European destinations (D(cid:252)sseldorf, Frankfurt, London and Paris).\n",

      "Northwest on Paris-Detroit. 29.  Since 2004, the cooperation between Delta, NWA and Air France/KLM has become more\n",
      "intense. KLM and NWA have joined the SkyTeam alliance, as anticipated in the competitive\n",
      "assessment for the Air France/KLM merger. Furthermore, Delta, NWA, Air France and\n",
      "KLM (\"SkyTeam 4\") also plan to establish a four-way joint venture for transatlantic routes,\n",
      "which  will  allow  the  four  carriers  to  coordinate  sales,  fares,  seat  allocations,  revenue\n",
      "management, schedules, flights, route network, and will pool costs and revenues for a\n",
      "common bottom line (so-called \"metal neutrality\" whereby a carrier selling a ticket becomes\n",
      "indifferent to which carrier actually operates the service). All these agreements are being\n",
      "investigated by the Commission in the SkyTeam case19, however the Commission has not\n",
      "yet taken a position on the compatibility of these agreements with Article 81 EC. The\n",
      "alliance agreements between Air France, KLM, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines, Delta and\n",
      "NWA (\"SkyTeam 6\") for transatlantic routes were granted antitrust immunity by the U.S.\n",
      "Department of Transportation on 22 May20. Accordingly, Delta and NWA are no longer\n",
      "limited in their direct cooperation on transatlantic routes by the U.S. antitrust rules (as\n",
      "previously only the KLM/NWA joint venture and the Delta/Air France/Alitalia/CSA Czech\n",
      "Airlines had formal U.S. antitrust immunity).\n",
      "30.  The limited incentive for Delta and NWA to compete due to their respective extensive\n",
      "cooperation  with  Air  France/KLM,  reinforced  by  the  planned  four-way  joint  venture\n",
      "between these carriers on transatlantic routes, constitutes the relevant counterfactual against\n",
      "which to assess the competitive impact of the merger of Delta and NWA.\n",
      "31.  For the purpose of assessing the impact of the Delta/Northwest merger, the Commission\n",
      "must therefore focus on merger-specific changes to the pre-merger competitive situation\n",
      "characterised by extensive cooperation on transatlantic routes between Delta, Northwest,\n",
      "France/KLM, Alitalia and CSA Czech Airlines, as recognized by the Commission in 2004.\n",
      "32.  The only change brought about by the merger as regards competition between Delta and\n",
      "Northwest is that the absence of effective competition between them will no longer result\n",
      "from cooperation agreements but from their integration into a single economic unit. The\n",
      "merger will create a permanent structural link between Delta and Northwest that replaces the\n",
      "extensive cooperation on transatlantic routes that currently takes place within the framework\n",
      "of SkyTeam.\n",
      "33.  Depending on the market position of the merging parties on the routes concerned, it cannot\n",
      "be excluded that a merger between two alliance partners could significantly affect the\n",
      "competitive situation on some routes, in particular on hub-to-hub routes. The Commission\n",
      "therefore analyzes below on a route by route basis the specific effects of the creation of a\n",
      "permanent structural link between the two merging parties in order to assess the extent to\n",
      "which competition may be affected post-merger. In this assessment, the Commission does\n",
      "not take a position on the compatibility of the existing cooperation agreements with Article\n",
      "81 EC, as it does not change the assessment, given the respective market position of the\n",
      "parties on the routes concerned. By focusing on the market position of Delta and NWA, the\n",

      "between  two  U.S.  network  carriers  with  different  hubs  and  with  services  that  are\n",
      "complementary rather than competing, there are actually very few O&D city pairs where\n",
