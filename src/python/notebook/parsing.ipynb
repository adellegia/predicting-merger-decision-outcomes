      "potentially affected by the proposed transaction. \n",
      "A.  Batteries – General introduction \n",
      "10.  Batteries are devices that produce electrical energy by means of a chemical interaction \n",
      "between a negative electrode (“anode”) and a positive electrode (“cathode”) through a \n",
      "conductive material (“electrolyte”). The resulting electricity may be tapped from the \n",
      "cell and used to power a wide range of devices. A “battery” is technically defined as an \n",
      "assembly of at least two cells, which may be arranged in series (in order to increase \n",
      "voltage), in parallel (in order to increase capacity), or both (in order to increase voltage \n",
      "and  capacity).  However,  even  single  cells  are  now  commonly  referred  to  as \n",
      "“batteries”5. \n",
      "11.  A fundamental distinction may be drawn between “primary” (more popularly known as \n",
      "“disposable”) batteries and “secondary” (hereafter “rechargeable”) batteries. Primary \n",
      "batteries hold more energy by size/weight (i.e. have a higher “energy density”) than \n",
      "rechargeable batteries, but may be used after purchase only until their chemical charge \n",
      "is depleted before being discarded. They cannot be reliably recharged because the \n",
      "chemical reactions that take place in the cell are not easily reversible and active \n",
      "materials may not return to their original form. Rechargeable batteries typically have a \n",
      "lower  energy  density  than  primary  cells  but  can  be  recharged  (i.e.  the  chemical \n",
      "reactions in the battery can be reversed by supplying electrical energy to the cell such \n",
      "that power can be drawn from the battery over multiple cycles). \n",
      "12.  The term “portable\" battery denotes sealed power cells that can be hand-carried and are \n",
      "meant for use in relatively small devices like mobile telephones, laptop computers, \n",
      "power tools, toys, and the like. This differentiates them from “heavy duty industrial” \n",
      "batteries (stationary power supplies that are used in businesses, factories and the like) \n",
      "and  “automotive”  batteries  (which  are  used  in  cars,  trucks,  and  other  wheeled \n",
      "vehicles)6. \n",

      "and optical pick ups (“OPUs”). Neither party to the transaction sells OPUs in the EEA. Sanyo does not \n",
      "sell tuners in the EEA. OPUs and tuners are therefore not considered further in this decision. \n",
      "5   Battery performance (i.e. a battery’s output) can be measured by both voltage and capacity. Voltage (“V”) \n",
      "is essentially electromotive force, and is equal to the difference of electrical potential between two points \n",
      "of a circuit carrying a constant current of one ampere. “Capacity” designates the nominal amount of \n",
      "energy that a battery can deliver over a period of time without overheating, and is commonly measured by \n",
      "reference to the amount of electricity transferred by a current of one ampere in one hour (“Ah”). In \n",
      "portable batteries, capacity is typically measured by “milliampere-hour” (“mAh”), which is 1/1000 of an \n",
      "ampere hour.  \n",
      "  Because the physical size of a battery determines how much anode material it can contain, and the anode \n",
      "is consumed in the chemical reaction that produces electric current, a large (e.g. D-size) battery has \n",
      "greater capacity than a smaller (e.g. AAA-size) one. However, each type of chemistry used in portable \n",

      "•  Lithium poly-carbon monofluoride \"Li(CF)n\" (hereafter 'BR' batteries) \n",

      "the majority of sales. Panasonic produces both CR and BR batteries while Sanyo is \n",
      "only active in CR batteries. \n",
      "20.  The Parties submit that CLBs constitute a single product market and that there is no \n",
      "need to further segment the market by sub-chemistries. Although each sub-chemistry \n",
      "has  its  own  distinct  features,  according  to  the  Parties,  customers  (mainly  device \n",
      "manufacturers) take these differences into consideration when designing the device and \n",
      "hence are able to substitute the different sub-chemistries for the \"same\" device.  \n",
      "21.  The result of the market investigation did not confirm the submission of the Parties as \n",
      "to a single product market for the different sub-chemistries of CLBs. On the contrary, \n",
      "as explained below, it generally indicates that the different sub-chemistries within \n",
      "CLBs constitute separate product markets, although there may exist some demand-side \n",
      "substitution between CR and BR chemistries. \n",
      "Supply substitutability between the different sub-chemistries \n",
      "22.  From  the  supply  side,  the  market  investigation  showed  that  the  different  sub-\n",
      "chemistries within CLBs are not substitutable. The market investigation revealed that a \n",
      "separate  production  line  is  needed  for  each  sub-chemistry  to  avoid  contamination \n",
      "(impurities) between the batteries. Accordingly, switching from one chemistry to the \n",
      "other seems to be very time consuming and requires significant investment which \n",
      "would not be undertaken by most of the producers in case of a price increase of 5-10%. \n",
      "5  The respondents to the market investigation also indicate that a specific know-how is \n",
      "required with respect to each sub-chemistry, which further limits the possibility of \n",
      "starting the production of a new sub-chemistry of CLBs. \n",
      "Demand substitutability between CR and FR batteries \n",
      "23.  The market investigation revealed that FR batteries do not compete with CR batteries \n",
      "or other sub-chemistries for most, if not all of the industrial end-applications. The main \n",
      "industrial applications of CR batteries are currently film cameras, smoke detectors, \n",
      "utility meters, burglar/car alarms and electronic toll collection (‘ETC’) devices.  \n",
      "24.  FR batteries do not compete for these end-applications as currently they are only sold \n",
      "for military applications and for retail/end customers. The technical and performance \n",
      "characteristics of FR batteries are very different from batteries sold for industrial \n",
      "applications  such  as  CR,  ER  and  BR  batteries8.  While  the  Parties  themselves \n",
      "acknowledge that FR batteries do not compete for industrial applications with CR \n",
      "batteries, they argue that in the near future they will capture a significant share of \n",
      "industrial sales. This has not been confirmed by the result of the Commission's market \n",
      "investigation. None of the customers who currently use CR batteries indicate that they \n",
      "would consider switching to FR batteries, should the price of CR batteries increase. \n",
      "25.  In light of the above, the Commission consider that FR batteries do not belong to the \n",
      "same product market as CR batteries.   \n",
      "Demand substitutability between CR and ER batteries \n",
      "26.  In line with the Parties' submission, the market investigation indicates that CR and ER \n",
      "batteries are used, to a large extent9, for different end-applications given their different \n",
      "technical characteristics (voltage, pulse capability, lifetime, temperature range, etc). \n",
      "27.  Given these different technical and performance characteristics, most of the customers \n",
      "do not regard them as substitutable for their end-applications/devices and thus are not \n",
      "willing to switch from CR to ER batteries should the price of the former increase.  \n",
      "28.  Moreover, given that ER batteries contain highly toxic material and are normally more \n",
      "expensive, customers are reluctant to switch from CR to ER batteries. Respondents \n",
      "indicate that there is a trend for certain end-applications such as utility meters and \n",
      "ETC-systems which are currently dominated by ER batteries to switch from ER to CR \n",
      "batteries. This results also from the fact that new applications can function with the \n",
      "lower voltage provided by CR batteries. \n",
      "29.  Based on the above, the Commission considers that CR and ER batteries do not belong \n",
      "to the same product market. \n",
      "                                                 \n",
      "8   FR batteries have a voltage of 1.5V whereas industrial type batteries have a voltage of 3V (CR and BR) \n",
      "and 3.6V(ER). Also, FR batteries have lower pulse capability (which refers to the cell’s ability to deliver \n",
      "strong power surges), lifetime and the temperature range within which the cell can be used. \n",
      "9   The use of CR and ER batteries overlaps to a very limited extent with regard to some (but not all) end-\n",
      "applications. However, the respective share of CR and ER batteries for these end-applications seems to be \n",
      "rather constant over the last three years. \n",
      "6  Demand substitutability between CR and BR batteries \n",
      "30.  As  to  the  substitution  between  CR  and  BR  chemistries,  the  result  of  the  market \n",
      "investigation was not entirely conclusive. Although CR and BR batteries differ in \n",
      "certain performance characteristics (e.g. pulse capability, lifetime), a certain number of \n",
      "customers indicated that they would be willing to switch from CR to BR batteries in \n",
      "case of a significant price increase for the former. This might be explained by the fact \n",
      "that both CR and BR have the same voltage of 3V, making the switch between the two \n",
      "sub-chemistries easier.  \n",
      "31.  Some customers explain however that even if CR and BR batteries are technically \n",
      "close to each other compared to other sub-chemistries, switching from one to another is \n",
      "difficult given the testing period and costly process that such a switch would require on \n",
      "the  part  of  device  manufacturers.  This  would  also  be  consistent  with  the  pricing \n",
      "analysis  that  was  performed  by  the  Commission  on  Panasonic's  customer-level \n",
      "transaction data (as Panasonic produces both BR and CR chemistry) that suggests that \n",

      "20  Li-ion batteries may be made with various sub-chemistries (as later discussed). The most popular material \n",
      "for the anode is graphite, while the cathode is generally a layered oxide (e.g. lithium cobalt oxide), \n",
      "polyanion (e.g. lithium iron phosphate), or spinel (e.g. lithium manganese oxide). An organic solvent \n",

      "VII.   ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSED REMEDIES \n",
      "Introduction \n",
      "213. As set out in the Commission Notice on Remedies, the Commission assesses the \n",
      "compatibility of a notified concentration with the common market in line with the \n",
      "terms of the EC Merger Regulation. Where a concentration raises serious doubts which \n",
      "could lead to a significant impediment to effective competition, the Parties may seek to \n",
      "modify  the  concentration  so  as  to  resolve  the  serious  doubts  identified  by  the \n",
      "Commission with a view to having the merger cleared. In assessing whether or not the \n",
      "remedy will restore effective competition, the Commission considers the type, scale \n",
      "and  scope  of  the  remedies  by  reference  to  the  structure  and  the  particular \n",
      "characteristics of the market in which these serious doubts arise. \n",
      "214. As concerns the different types of remedy, the most effective way to maintain effective \n",
      "competition is to create the conditions for the emergence of a new competitive entity or \n",
      "for the strengthening of existing competitors via divestiture by the merging Parties. \n",
      "The  divested  activities  must  consist  of  a  viable  business,  which  if  operated  by  a \n",
      "suitable purchaser, can compete effectively with the merged entity on a lasting basis \n",
      "and which is divested as a going concern. \n",
      "215. The Commission's assessment has concluded that the proposed remedy package as \n",
      "submitted by the Parties on 28 September 2009 addresses all serious doubts identified \n",
      "during the course of the procedure and adequately deals with concerns identified by \n",
      "market participants in response to the remedy package. As such, the Commission has \n",
      "concluded that the proposed remedy package is effective in removing the serious \n",
      "doubts brought about by the transaction in the relevant markets. \n",
      "Suitability  to  remove  the  serious  doubts  raised  with  regards  to  the  -CLB  and \n",
      "rechargeable coin-shaped battery markets \n",
      "216. The divestment of the Tottori plant proposed by the Parties to address the competition \n",
      "concerns identified with regard to the market for CR-CLB and rechargeable coin-\n",
      "shaped batteries constitutes Sanyo's sole manufacturing facility for both CLBs93 and \n",
      "                                                 \n",
      "93   CR CLB batteries, the only sub chemistry of CLB that Sanyo is currently producing. \n",
      "42  rechargeable coin-shaped batteries. Therefore, the proposed divestment will eliminate \n",
      "the entire overlap between the Parties in the manufacture and sale of CLBs94 and \n",
      "rechargeable coin-shaped batteries in the EEA and worldwide.  \n",
      "217. In 2008, the Sanyo Tottori Divestment Business generated a turnover of approximately \n",
      "EUR […] million from the sale of CR-CLBs, which represents [20-30%] of the total \n",
      "sales of CR-CLB worldwide. In the EEA, Sanyo has an even higher market share of \n",
      "[30-40%]. Sanyo is the largest CR-CLB supplier in the EEA and the second largest \n",
      "worldwide.  \n",
      "218. Similarly in rechargeable coin-shaped batteries Sanyo has a very strong presence in the \n",
      "market.  The  Sanyo  Tottori  Divestment  Business  in  2008  generated  a  turnover  of \n",
      "approximately EUR […] million which represents [20-30%] of the worldwide market \n",
      "of rechargeable coin-shaped batteries.  \n",
      "219. Accordingly, the potential purchaser of the Sanyo Tottori Divestment Business will \n",
      "become a sizeable supplier of both CR-CLB and rechargeable coin-shaped batteries.    \n",
      "220. The market test provided positive feedback on the proposed Sanyo Tottori Divestment \n",
      "Business.  Respondents  also  considered  that  the  proposed  divestment  in  principle \n",
      "includes  all  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  necessary  to  successfully  run  the \n",
      "business and to enable a potential purchaser to become a viable competitor in these \n",
      "markets, able to effectively compete against the merged entity. Some respondents \n",
      "highlighted that the transfer of sale, marketing and R&D personnel as well as patents \n",
      "that are predominantly used in the production process are essential to successfully run \n",
      "the divested business. The divestment as modified by the Parties on 28 September 2009 \n",
      "has been improved in this respect. In particular, instead of a royalty-free licence of \n",
      "patents as originally foreseen by the Parties, all patents predominantly used in the \n",
      "divestment business will be transferred to the Purchaser. Moreover the scope of any \n",
      "licence back of patents from the Purchaser to the Parties will be limited to applications \n",
      "other than CLB and rechargeable coin-shaped batteries. In addition, the provisions for \n",
      "the  transfer  of  sales,  marketing  and  R&D  personnel  have  been  reinforced.  The \n",
      "modified commitments thereby ensure the competitiveness of the divestment business. \n",
      "221. The market investigation indicated that the Sanyo Tottori Divestment Business is likely \n",
      "to attract the interest of several buyers. Indeed, several respondents to the market \n",
      "investigation have expressed an interest in purchasing the Sanyo Tottori Divestment \n",
      "Business.  In  this  respect,  a  majority  of  respondents  indicated  that  the  suitable \n",
      "Purchaser should have technical know-how and experience of the battery business and \n",
      "that an existing battery manufacturer would be best-placed to compete effectively with \n",
      "the merged entity. \n",
      "222. In  light  of  the  above,  the  Commission  considers  the  Sanyo  Tottori  Divestment \n",
      "Business as a suitable commitment to remedy the competition concerns identified with \n",
      "regard to the market for CL-CLB and rechargeable coin-shaped batteries.  \n",
      "Suitability  to  remove  the  serious  doubts  raised  with  regards  to  the  portable \n",
      "rechargeable NiMH batteries markets \n",
      "                                                 \n",
      "94   Irrespective of whether the product market definition includes only CR or both CR and BR-CLBs, given \n",
      "that Sanyo is only active in the production and sale of CR-CLBs. \n",
      "43  223. Each of the proposed divestment alternatives for portable NiMH batteries is suitable to \n",
      "eliminate the serious doubts identified. Therefore, the Commission has accepted in this \n",
      "specific case both proposed remedies as alternatives.  \n",
      "224. Both Sanyo’s and Panasonic’s NIMH Divestment Business Alternatives include all the \n",
      "production facilities of the Parties in relation to their portable NiMH businesses.95 \n",
      "Therefore, both Divestment Business Alternatives will eliminate the entire overlap \n",
      "between the Parties in the manufacture and sale of NiMH in the EEA and worldwide. \n",
      "Furthermore, Sanyo and Panasonic are strong market players in both the EEA and \n",
      "worldwide.  In  2008,  the  Sanyo  NiMH  Divestment  Business  Alternative  generated \n",
      "turnover of approximately EUR […] million whilst the Panasonic NiMH Divestment \n",
      "Business  Alternative  generated  turnover  of  approximately  EUR  […]  million. \n",
      "Accordingly, the acquisition of either NiMH Divestment Business Alternative will \n",
      "allow the potential purchaser to become a sizeable supplier of portable NiMH batteries. \n",
      "225. The market investigation has broadly confirmed that the tangible and intangible assets \n",
      "necessary  for  a  stand-alone  viable  business  are  included  in  both  divestment \n",
      "alternatives.  However,  some  concerns  were  expressed  concerning  the  necessary \n",
      "personnel and intellectual property rights. The Divestment Alternatives as modified by \n",
      "the Parties on 28 September 2009 have been improved in this respect. In particular, \n",
      "instead of a royalty-free licence of patents as originally foreseen by the Parties, all \n",
      "patents  predominantly  used  in  the  divestment  business  will  be  transferred  to  the \n",
      "Purchaser. Moreover the scope of any licence back of patents from the Purchaser to the \n",
      "Parties  will  be  limited  to  applications  other  than  portable  NiMH  batteries.96  In \n",
      "addition, the provisions for the transfer of sales, marketing and R&D personnel have \n",
      "been reinforced. The modified commitments thereby ensure the competitiveness of the \n",
      "divestment business. \n",
      "226. Furthermore,  during  the  market  investigation several potential buyers have shown \n",
      "interest in both alternatives.  \n",
      "227. Based  on  the  above,  the  Commission  has  concluded  that  both  NiMH  Divestment \n",
      "Business  Alternatives  are  appropriate  to  remedy  the  serious  doubts  identified  in \n",
      "portable NiMH batteries. As noted in the commitments the Parties commit to ring-\n",
      "fence  both  Divestment  Alternatives  until  such  time  as  the  closing  of  one  of  the \n",
      "divestments on terms approved by the Commission takes place. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "                                                 \n",
      "95   As noted above, at the request of the Purchaser and following a report from the Trustee, the Commission \n",
      "may approve the sale of the Sanyo NiMH Divestment Business without the transfer of the sub C and D \n",
      "production assets in Suzhou, provided that appropriate arrangements are put in place in order to ensure \n",
      "the supply of these battery sizes to the Purchaser, if this does not affect the viability and competitiveness \n",
      "of the Sanyo NiMH Divestment Business after the sale, taking account of the proposed Purchaser. \n",
      "96   This restriction will also apply to portable NiMH batteries sold under Sanyo's or Panasonic's respective \n",
      "brand names in the retail channel for a period not exceeding […] (at the option of the purchaser) where a \n",
