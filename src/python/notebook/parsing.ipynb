      "Notification  of  23  June  2008  pursuant  to  Article  4  of  Council  Regulation\n",
      "No 139/20041\n",
      "1.  On 23 June 2008, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration\n",
      "pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (\"EC Merger Regulation\") by\n",
      "which the undertaking Delta Air Lines, Inc. (\"Delta\", U.S.) acquires within the meaning of\n",
      "Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation control of the whole of the undertaking Northwest\n",
      "Airline Corporation (\"NWA\", U.S.) by way of purchase of shares.\n",
      "I. THE PARTIES\n",
      "2.  Delta is a U.S. flag commercial airline that provides scheduled air passenger and cargo\n",
      "transport  and  related  services.  In  2007,  Delta  flew  to  119  international  destinations,\n",
      "including 32 destinations to/from the European Union. Delta has hubs at the following\n",
      "airports: Atlanta, Cincinnati, New York-JFK and Salt Lake City. Delta is a member of the\n",
      "SkyTeam alliance.\n",
      "                                                \n",
      "1  OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1.\n",
      "Commission europØenne, B-1049 Bruxelles / Europese Commissie, B-1049 Brussel - Belgium. Telephone: (32-2) 299 11 11. 3.  NWA is also a U.S. flag commercial airline that provides scheduled air passenger and cargo\n",
      "transport and related services. In 2007, NWA offered scheduled air transportation services to\n",
      "50 international destinations, including 15 routes to/from the European Union. NWA has\n",
      "hubs at the following airports: Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Tokyo-Narita.\n",
      "Northwest is also a member of the SkyTeam alliance since 2004.\n",
      "II. THE OPERATION\n",
      "4.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement entered by Delta and NWA on 14 April 2008, NWA will\n",
      "merge  with  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Delta,  as  a  result  of  which  NWA  and  its\n",
      "subsidiaries will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of Delta.\n",
      "III. THE CONCENTRATION\n",
      "5.  Following the merger of NWA with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta, Delta will acquire\n",
      "sole control of NWA and its subsidiaries. The proposed operation constitutes a concentration\n",
      "within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.\n",
      " IV. COMMUNITY DIMENSION\n",
      "6.  The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover of more than\n",
      "EUR 5 000 million2 (Delta EUR [CONFIDENTIAL] and NWA EUR [CONFIDENTIAL]).\n",
      "Each of them have a Community-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (Delta EUR\n",
      "[CONFIDENTIAL] million and NWA EUR [CONFIDENTIAL] million), but they do not\n",
      "achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate Community-wide turnover within one and\n",
      "the same Member State. The notified concentration has a Community dimension within the\n",
      "meaning of Article 1(2) of the Merger Regulation.\n",
      "V. THE RELEVANT PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS\n",
      "7.  As far as European markets are concerned, Delta and Northwest are both active in air\n",
      "passenger  and  cargo  transport  between  Europe  and  the  United  States.  The  proposed\n",
      "transaction thus leads to overlaps in two areas in the EEA: (i) scheduled passenger air\n",
      "transport; and (ii) air cargo transport.\n",
      "A. Scheduled air transport of passengers\n",
      "                                                \n",
      "2  Turnover  calculated  in  accordance  with  Article  5(1)  of  the  Merger  Regulation  and  the  Commission\n",
      "Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice (OJ C 95, 16.4.2008, p. 1). The parties’ turnover figures are based on a 50:50\n",
      "split between the country of departure and the country of final destination (see also Case COMP/M.4439 -\n",
      "Ryanair/Aer Lingus, at paragraphs 16 and following). Should the turnover figures be based on the point of\n",
      "origin of the flights as considered in Ryanair/Aer Lingus case, the Community dimension thresholds would be\n",
      "equally satisfied.. (1)  Point of origin/point of destination (\"O&D\") pairs\n",
      "8.  The Commission has in the past defined the relevant market for scheduled passenger air\n",
      "transport services on the basis of the (cid:147)point of origin/point of destination(cid:148) (O&D) city-pair\n",
      "approach3.  This  market  definition  corresponds  to  the  demand-side  perspective  whereby\n",
      "customers consider all possible alternatives of travelling from a point of origin (\"O\") to a\n",
      "point of destination (\"D\"), which they do not consider substitutable to a different city-pair.\n",
      "On this basis, every combination of a point of origin and a point of destination is considered\n",
      "to be a separate market.\n",
      "9.  The Commission has nevertheless in the past also taken into consideration supply-side\n",
      "elements  such  as  network  competition  between  airlines  based  on  the  hub-and-spoke\n",
      "structure of traditional carriers. Although in theory from a supply-side perspective a carrier\n",
      "could fly from any point of origin to any point of destination, in practice the network carriers\n",
      "construct their network and take decisions to fly almost exclusively on routes connecting to\n",
      "their hubs. From a demand-side perspective, it was generally considered that while networks\n",
      "have some importance for corporate customers whose demand is driven both by network\n",
      "effects and O&D considerations, their role remains rather limited for individual customers\n",
      "who are normally concerned with finding the cheapest and most convenient connection\n",
      "between two cities4.\n",
      "10.  The market investigation has generally confirmed that the market should be defined on the\n",
      "basis  of  the  Commission’s  traditional  O&D  city  pair  approach.  Indeed,  the  market\n",
      "investigation indicated that individual customers would not substitute one O&D for another.\n",
      "While the scope of a network is one of the decisive parameters taken into account by\n",
      "corporate customers when contracting with airlines and the discounts granted by airlines to\n",
      "corporate  customers  are  conditional  upon  corporate  customers  purchasing  the  tickets\n",
      "generally  on  a  network  (rather  than  on  a  route-by-route  basis),  corporate  customers’\n",
      "employees needs still revolve around transport from one point to another and competition\n",
      "still takes place on an O&D city pair basis.\n",
      "11.  Accordingly, for the purpose of this decision, the relevant markets should be defined on an\n",
      "O&D basis.\n",
      "(2)  Time-sensitive v. non time-sensitive passengers\n",
      "12.  The Commission has traditionally found that passengers travelling on unrestricted tickets,\n",
      "i.e.  time-sensitive  passengers  which  are  mainly  business  customers  having  a  need  for\n",
      "flexibility, may be in a different market from passengers travelling on restricted tickets, so-\n",
      "called non time-sensitive passengers attaching more importance to the price than to the\n",
      "frequency or direct/indirect itinerary of the flight5.\n",
      "                                                \n",
      "3  See, e.g., Case COMP/M.3280 - Air France/KLM, at paragraphs 9 and following, and Case COMP/M.3770 -\n",
      "Lufthansa/Swiss, at paragraphs 12 and following.\n",
      "4  See Case COMP/M.3280 - Air France/KLM, at paragraphs 11-16.\n",
      "5  See, e.g., Case COMP/M.3280 - Air France/KLM, at paragraph 19 and Case COMP/M.3770 - Lufthansa/Swiss,\n",
      "at paragraph 15. 13.  In its recent Ryaniar/Aer Lingus6 decision the Commission did not distinguish between\n",
      "time-sensitive and non time-sensitive passengers. However, there is a clear difference with\n",
      "the present case as in Europe both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are low-frills short-haul point-to-\n",
      "point operators selling one type of tickets whereas the case at hand relates to a merger\n",
      "between two network airlines offering transatlantic long haul flights, selling different types\n",
      "of tickets targeting different categories of passengers and achieving a considerable part of\n",
      "their turnover through sales to business or time-sensitive passengers.\n",
      "14.  The market investigation in the present case has confirmed that this distinction is still\n",
      "relevant although the boundaries between time-sensitive and non time-sensitive passengers\n",
      "have become more blurred over time and there is rather a continuum of types of passengers\n",
      "having various combinations of preferences with respect to price, flexibility of ticket and\n",
      "frequency of flights. In particular, there is a trend among corporate customers, representing\n",
      "most of the time-sensitive passengers, to be more flexible and prioritise the price of the\n",
      "ticket  over  other  factors,  such  as  time.  One  respondent  to  the  Commission’s  market\n",
      "investigation indicated that the \"companies tend to move towards the \"cheapest logical fare\"\n",
      "meaning that companies are still willing to pay more for improved flexibility and travel\n",
      "convenience  as  long  as  amounts  are  perceived  reasonable.\"  However,  this  distinction\n",
      "remains still important due to different needs and requirements of time-sensitive passengers\n",
      "as concerns the flexibility of tickets, possibility of late bookings and the service offered on\n",
      "the aircraft. In addition, from a supply-side perspective, airlines’ yield and their business\n",
      "strategy are to a large extent driven by this distinction.\n",
      "15.  In any case, the existence of distinct markets for time sensitive and non-time sensitive\n",
      "passengers can be left open as it does not alter the competition assessment in the present\n",
      "case.\n",
      "(3)  Substitutability of direct and indirect flights\n",
      "16.  With respect to long-haul flights the Commission has found in the past7 that indirect flights\n",
      "constitute  a  competitive  alternative  to  non-stop  services  under  certain  conditions  in\n",
      "particular when they are marketed as connecting flights on an O&D pair in the computer\n",
      "reservation systems, they operate on a daily basis and they only result in a limited increase\n",
      "of travelling time (max. 150 minutes of waiting time).\n",
      "17.  The market investigation has largely confirmed that indirect flights constitute an alternative\n",
      "to direct flights for the transatlantic city-pairs considered. This is particularly true for non\n",
      "time-sensitive passengers. With respect to time-sensitive passengers, it is clear that in case\n",
      "both direct and indirect flights are offered, there is a clear preference for a direct flight.\n",
      "However, in some circumstances, and in particular where the frequencies/schedules of an\n",
      "indirect service are more convenient or when there is a company policy whereby some\n",
      "airlines are preferred over the others, an indirect service may constitute a substitute even for\n",
      "                                                \n",
      "6  See Case COMP/M.4439 Ryanair/Aer Lingus, at paragraphs 85 and 316-319.\n",
      "7  See, e.g., Case COMP/M.2041 - United/US Airways, at paragraphs 13-19 as regards specifically transatlantic\n",
      "city-pairs. time-sensitive passengers. Moreover, in line with the increased price-sensitivity of corporate\n",
      "customers the market investigation indicated that some corporate customers have policies\n",
      "whereby they incite their employees to take reasonable connecting flights, in particular when\n",
      "the price difference is substantial.\n",
      "18.  Accordingly, for the purposes of the present decision, indirect flights resulting in only a\n",
      "limited increase in time are considered to be part of the same relevant market on each\n",
      "relevant transatlantic city-pair.\n",
      "B. Air cargo transport\n",
      "19.  With respect to air cargo market, the Commission has previously found that O&D approach\n",
      "to market definition is inappropriate given that cargo is generally less time-sensitive than\n",
      "passengers and that cargo is commonly transported by trans-modal methods beyond and\n",
      "behind the origin and destination points. Accordingly, the geographic market can be defined\n",
      "wider  and  as  concerns  the  intercontinental  routes,  the  corresponding  catchment  areas\n",
      "broadly correspond to continents, at least for those continents where local infrastructure is\n",
      "adequate to allow for onward connections8. This is the case of the North Atlantic routes\n",
      "(routes between Europe and North America) affected by the present transaction. In this\n",
      "respect it should be noted that the cargo transport is by nature unidirectional as the demand\n",
      "on each end of the route differs substantially. Accordingly, the relevant markets have to be\n",
      "defined on this basis.\n",
      "20.  The Commission in previous cases left open the question whether the market for air cargo\n",
      "transport should be further subdivided depending on the nature of transported goods. The\n",
      "Commission however indicated that some type of goods, such as dangerous goods, may\n",
      "require special handling so that they can be transported only on full-freighter aircraft9.\n",
      "However, on the transatlantic routes concerned by the present transaction neither of the\n",
      "parties operates dedicated cargo aircraft which could allow for this special treatment and\n",
      "thus typically they transport general cargo. In light of this and the parties’ limited activities\n",
      "in the transport of air cargo between Europe and the U.S., it is irrelevant for the purposes of\n",
      "this case to further subdivide the cargo market.\n",
      "21.  Accordingly, the relevant markets for the purpose of this case are the transport of air cargo\n",
      "from Europe to North America and the transport of air cargo from North America to Europe.\n",
      "                                                \n",
      "8  See Case COMP/M.3280 - Air France/KLM, at paragraph 36 and Case COMP/M.3770 -Lufthansa/Swiss, at\n",
