      "(393)  On 20 June 2019, the Commission launched a market test with the purpose of \n",
      "verifying whether the Initial Commitments were sufficient to clearly rule out the \n",
      "serious  doubts  identified  by  the  Commission  (see  Section  IV.3.1.2  of  this \n",
      "Decision). In particular, the market test aimed at verifying whether the Initial \n",
      "Commitments were overall suitable to address the competitive concerns identified \n",
      "and likely to enable the Divestment Business to continue acting as a competitive \n",
      "force on the TPM segment. The market test also aimed to seek feedback about the \n",
      "relevant criteria to identify a suitable purchaser for the Divestment Business. \n",
      "(394)  Overall, the feedback received from respondents to the market test was positive. \n",
      "The  overwhelming  majority  of  respondents  considered  that  the  commitments \n",
      " \n",
      "97   \n",
      "were  overall  suitable  to  remove  the  concerns  identified  in  the  TPM  area.342 \n",
      "Respondents considered, generally, that the Divestment Business includes the \n",
      "necessary  combination  of  assets,343  and  is  likely  to  constitute  an  attractive \n",
      "investment opportunity for a range of purchasers.344  \n",
      "(395)  However, the results of the market test also identified issues with the Initial \n",
      "Commitments requiring further improvements.  \n",
      "(396)  Firstly,  respondents  required  clarifications  regarding  the  assets,  rights,  and \n",
      "information  transferred  to  the  Divestment  Business,  so  as  to  ensure  that  it \n",
      "includes all relevant third party licenses and historical data on sales, pricing, as \n",
      "well as clinical data.345 \n",
      "(397)  Secondly, a number of respondents indicated that the duration of the transitory \n",
      "supply  agreements,  as  initially  foreseen,  was  not  sufficient.  While  the  exact \n",
      "duration  considered  suitable  for  such  agreements  ([Time  period])  was  not \n",
      "disclosed to respondents as part of the market test, a majority of competitors \n",
      "indicated that such supply agreements should last for a period of two-three years \n",
      "or more.346  \n",
      "(398)  Thirdly, the market test indicated that criteria to assess the suitability of the \n",
      "purchaser should be adjusted to require specifically: (i) experience in the sale and \n",
      "marketing of pharmaceuticals,347 in particular OTC pharmaceutical products348 \n",
      "(but not necessarily medical devices);349 (ii) the ability to innovate in the field of \n",

      "place in countries where the purchaser does not have its own salesforce.351 \n",
      "(399)  Fourthly  and  lastly,  a  number  of  competitors  raised  concerns  about  the \n",
      "preservation of the viability and competitiveness of the Divestment Business in \n",

      "5.  FINAL COMMITMENTS \n",
      "(400)  The Commission communicated to the Parties a summary of the comments made \n",
      "by respondents to the market test, as well as its preliminary assessment of these \n",
      "comments.  \n",
      "(401)  In order to address the results of the market test, the Parties submitted the Final \n",
      "Commitments on 9 July 2019. The Final Commitments differ from the Initial \n",
      "Commitments on the following main aspects:  \n",
      "  The scope of the rights and assets transferred as part of the Divestment \n",
      "Business has been clarified so as to include: (i) IP rights used under third-\n",
      "party licenses; and (ii) historic and current financial/accounting, pricing, \n",
      "sales, and clinical data.  \n",
      "  The purchaser criteria have been amended to ensure that the purchaser: (i) \n",
      "has experience in the supply of OTC products (but not necessarily medical \n",
      "devices); (ii) has existing third-party access to distribution channels in case \n",
      "it does not have its own presence in each relevant EEA market; and (iii) has \n",
      "the ability to innovate.  \n",
      "  Transitional  supply  agreements  have  been  extended  from  a  period  not \n",
      "exceeding [Time period] with a possibility to extend them for [Time period] \n",
      "(that is [Time period] maximum), to a period not exceeding [Time period] \n",
      "with  a  possibility  to  extend  such  agreement  for  [Time  period]  of  a \n",
      "maximum duration of [Time period] (first period), [Time period] (second \n",
      "period) and [Time period] (third period) respectively, potentially bringing \n",
      "the total duration of such agreements to [Time period].  \n",
      "  The  first  divestiture  period  has  been  reduced.  The  timing  of  other \n",
      "procedural  steps,  in  particular  in  relation  to  the  nomination  of  the \n",
      "monitoring trustee, has also been revised accordingly. \n",
      "  The Parties additionally offer that the Purchaser will have the opportunity, \n",
      "on request, to interview and employ up to [50-60]% of Pfizer CH personnel \n",
      "involved in the sale of ThermaCare in [Geography]. \n",
      "  The Parties additionally commit not to integrate the Pfizer CH operations \n",
      "(including  all  employees)  with  any  operations  of  GSK  (including  all \n",
      "employees)  in  [Geography]),  until  the  closing  of  the  acquisition  of  the \n",
      "Divestment Business by a suitable purchaser.  \n",

      " \n",
      "99   \n",
      "  The Parties additionally commit to put in place specific incentive schemes \n",
      "to promote sales of ThermaCare products in [Geography], until the closing \n",
      "of the acquisition of the Divestment Business by a suitable purchaser. \n",
      "6.  ASSESSMENT OF THE FINAL COMMITMENTS \n",
      "(402)  The Commission notes that the Final Commitments remove nearly the entire \n",
      "overlap between the Parties in the area of TPM products in the EEA. Only minor \n",
      "overlaps would remain post-Transaction in the Netherlands and France, where \n",
      "Pfizer  sells  its  AdvilMed,  Advil  Gel  and/or  Kamol  products.  However,  these \n",
      "limited  overlaps  do  not  raise  serious  doubts  as  to  the  compatibility  of  the \n",
      "Transaction with the internal market.353  \n",
      "(403)  In addition, the Commission considers that the Divestment Business is a viable \n",
      "and  competitive  business.  In  particular,  from  a  financial  perspective,  the \n",
      "Divestment Business has consistently been operating profitably over the past \n",
      "three years.354  \n",
      "(404)  The Commission also considers that the Divestment Business, as per the Final \n",
      "Commitments,  includes  all  the  necessary  assets,  functions  and  personnel \n",
      "necessary  for  the  manufacturing  and  supply  of  ThermaCare  products  by  a \n",
      "suitable purchaser.  \n",
      "(405)  The Divestment Business will also largely be independent from the Parties post-\n",
      "Transaction,  as  the  transitional  supply  arrangements,  which  do  not  exceed  a \n",
      "maximum period of [Time period], aim at supporting the Divestment Business in \n",
      "limited areas only, and ensure that no disruption in the supply of TPM products \n",
      "occurs in the EEA.  \n",
      "(406)  In addition, the Purchaser criteria included in the Final Commitments ensure that \n",
      "the purchaser has sufficient experience in the supply of OTC pharmaceutical \n",
      "products,  as  well  as  immediate  access  to  a  salesforce  in  the  relevant  EEA \n",
      "countries. These criteria ensure the purchaser’s ability to readily and successfully \n",
      "continue  to  market  ThermaCare  products,  and  to  compete  effectively,  in \n",
      "particular against the Combined CH Business.  \n",
      "(407)  Finally,  the  viability  of  the  Divestment  Business,  and  in  particular  the \n",
      "ThermaCare brand equity, is preserved under the Final Commitments. Pfizer CH \n",
      "salesforce in [Geography] will not offer GSK products during the (shortened) \n",
      "divestiture period. This ensures that ThermaCare sales cannot be cannibalized by \n",
      "competing GSK products. In fact, the Final Commitments provide for financial \n",
      "incentives for Pfizer CH employees to increase the sales of ThermaCare, which is \n",
      "likely  to  make  sales  of  these  products  more  attractive  to  employees, \n",
      "                                                 \n",
      "353   In both France and the Netherlands, Pfizer CH’s increment will remain small. In France, Pfizer \n",
      "CH’s AdvilMed gel, Advil Gel and Kamol account for a combined value share of [0-5]% in the \n",
      "topical  pain  management  category  (02E1)  and  [0-5]%  in  the  OTC  4  class  02E10 \n",
      "(ointments/creams).  In the Netherlands, Advil Gel accounts for a share of [0-5]% in the topical \n",
      "pain management category (02E1) and [0-5]% in the OTC 4 class 02E1O (ointments/creams).  \n",

      "100   \n",
      "comparatively to the sales of other Pfizer CH OTC products. In addition, the \n",
      "possibility for the purchaser to interview and employ Pfizer CH sales personnel \n",
      "imply that these employees may also have a longer term interest in the promotion \n",
      "of ThermaCare products. This combined set of features protects the value of the \n",
      "ThermaCare brand and its competitive presence on the market over the course of \n",
      "the (shortened) divestiture period, and beyond.  \n",
      "(408)  In view of the elements discussed in this Section, the Commission concludes that \n",
      "the  Final  Commitments  are  suitable  to  remove  the  competition  concerns \n",
      "identified in Section IV.3.1.2 with regards to the supply of TPM products in the \n",

      "(413)  As consideration for the transfer of Pfizer CH to GSK, Pfizer will obtain a share \n",
      "of 32% in the Combined CH Business. Pfizer will acquire this minority share in \n",
      "the Combined CH Business because the Transaction is partly structured as an \n",
      "exchange deal. The Commission routinely reviews exchange offers resulting in a \n",
      "corollary  acquisition  of  minority  interests.  In  these  cases,  the  Commission’s \n",

      "overlap with those of Pfizer’s retained business.  \n",
      "(415)  The overlaps between the activities of the Combined CH Business and of Pfizer’s \n",

      "Luxembourg,  Portugal  and  Greece,  and  between  [0-5]%  and  [0-5]%  in \n",

      "where Pfizer will retain Artrox, which has a market share of less than [0-\n",
      "5]%. According to the Notifying Party, the rationale for Pfizer to keep the \n",

      "c)  Antifungals – D1A (ATC 3) / 06G3 (OTC 3) in Finland and Norway, where \n",
      "Pfizer will mainly retain Diflucan and Trosyd which has a market share of \n",

      "have low market shares and that the market investigation did not reveal that any \n",
      "of those products plays a significant role in the relevant markets. Therefore, the \n",
      "Commission considers it unlikely that the acquisition of a minority stake by \n",

      "(417)  In relation to (c), the Notifying Party claimed that the Combined CH Business \n",
      "and Pfizer’s respective products are based on different active ingredients: Trosyd is \n",
      "an antifungal product relying on tioconazole as an active ingredient, whereas Lamisil \n",
      "uses terbinafine hydrochloride. According to the Notifying Party, terbinafine/Lamisil \n",
      "is  much  more  effective  and  requires  a  one  day  or  week  treatment,  whereas \n",
      "tioconazole/Trosyd requires treatment of 2-3 weeks. The Notifying Party also added \n",
      "that, even though they are both topical products, Trosyd OTC is only available as a \n",
      "cream, whereas Lamisil is also sold in liquid, dusting powder and spray forms. The \n",
      "Combined CH Business will have market shares of about [30-40]% in Finland \n",
      "and [20-30]% in Norway at ATC 3 level, which mostly result from the Combined \n",
      "CH  Business’s  sales  of  products  marketed  under  the  brand  Lamisil.  Pfizer’s \n",
      "Trosyd has a market share of less than [0-5]%. The Commission notes that other \n",
      "strong competitors will remain on the markets concerned post-Transaction. As \n",
      "regards Finland: Johnson & Johnson (with a market share of [10-20]%), Orion \n",
      "([10-20]%), and Bayer ([5-10]%). As regards Norway: Bayer (with a market \n",
      "share of [40-50]%) and Orifarm ([5-10]%). In both EEA Member States, there are \n",
      "competitors who would enjoy similar or larger market shares compared to those \n",
      "of  Pfizer  (notably,  Johnson  &  Johnson  and  Orion  in  Finland,  and  Bayer  in \n",
      "Norway), that would keep exerting competitive pressure on Pfizer itself, as well \n",
      "as on the Combined CH Business. In addition, there is no indication that Diflucan \n",
      "and  Lamisil  are  close  competitors  as  they  are  based  on  different  active \n",
      "ingredients, have different galenic form, and are used for different indications. \n",
      "The  market  investigation  did  not  produce  evidence  contradicting  this \n",

      "Commission considers it unlikely that the acquisition of a minority stake by \n",
      "Pfizer in the Combined CH Business will weaken its incentives to compete in the \n",

      "(418)  In relation to (d), according to the Notifying Party, the limited overlap with \n",
      "Pursennid Ex-Lax will not affect Pfizer’s incentives to compete post-Transaction \n",
      "for the two following reasons. First, as Pursennid Ex-Lax has limited sales in \n",
      "Finland (namely, €[Limited sales] according to IQVIA OTC-IMS and £[Limited \n",
      "sales]  of  wholesale  sales  from  GSK  to  direct  customers),  competing  less \n",
      "aggressively would not be profitable for Pfizer. Second, Pursennid Ex-Lax and \n",
      "Vi-Siblin  are  not  close  competitors.  Vi-Siblin is  a  fibre  laxative,  with  active \n",
      "ingredient plantago ovata, and sold in powders/granules, while Pursennid Ex-Lax \n",
      "is a contact laxative, with active ingredient sennosides A&B, and sold in coated \n",
      "tablets.359 The Commission observes that Combined CH Business has indeed a \n",
      "limited share (of less than [0-5]%) on the market. The Commission also notes that \n",
      "strong competitors will remain on the market post-Transaction including Mylan \n",
      "(with a market share of [20-30]%), Takeda ([10-20]%) and Orion ([10-20]%), and \n",
      "will continue to  exert competitive pressure on Pfizer  and the Combined CH \n",
      "Business.  Furthermore,  the  market  investigation  did  not  produce  evidence \n",
      "contradicting  this  reasoning.  Therefore,  on  the  basis  of  the  elements  at  its \n",
      "disposal, the Commission considers it unlikely that the acquisition of a minority \n",
      "stake by Pfizer in  the Combined CH Business will weaken its incentives to \n",
      "compete  in  the  relevant  markets  for  laxatives  and  that  this  could  have  any \n",
      "material detrimental effects on the markets concerned.  \n",
      "(419)  Finally, the Commission notes that the activities of Pfizer and of the Combined \n",
      "CH Business would not overlap in the EEA as regards Pfizer’s retained switch \n",
      "products, that is to say, products that are likely to switch from Rx to OTC status \n",
      "in the EEA in the near future.  \n",
      "(420)  In view of the above and the available evidence, the Commission concludes that \n",
      "the Transaction does not lead to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the \n",
      "internal  market  in  relation  to  the  acquisition  by  Pfizer  of  a  non-controlling \n",
